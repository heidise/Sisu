# Programming 3 group project: SISU

SISU is a study planning application implemented with Java. The program fetches data from Kori API (degree and course information) and updates the graphical user interface according to userâ€™s choices. User can register, log in, view and change their study plans and also modify their own user information.

**See more information on the project documentation which can be found under /Documentation folder.**

Group members and word division:
- Heidi Seppi: Backend (fetching, handling and modifying data from API)
- Shuang: Frontend (GUI)
- Venla: Testing

**Running the code:**

SISU is a Java Maven project, so to run it you can use Apache Netbeans or use the terminal:

- `mvn clean install`
- `mvn javafx:run`

Known fault is that fetching the data lots of some time when the user logs in to the system. In the documentation, known faults have been explained.
